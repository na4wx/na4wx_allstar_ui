// Package cloudagent is this node's optional, off-by-default connection
// to the public cloud platform (a separate product — see its own repo's
// docs for the cloud side). When the operator opts in on the local
// "Cloud Sync" settings card with an API key generated on the cloud
// site, this package dials out to it (never the reverse — see
// SettingsStore's doc comment and this package's Run) and services
// relayed JSON actions.
//
// This is one of two HTTP-facing layers built on the same internal/*
// domain packages (internal/config, internal/system, ...) that
// internal/server also wraps for its local html UI — internal/server
// renders HTML for a session-authenticated LAN browser, cloudagent
// speaks JSON over a single outbound connection authenticated by API
// key. Both are thin; the actual business logic lives once, in
// internal/*. See internal/rptstatus for the parsing layer both share
// for app_rpt CLI output specifically.
//
// The action registry (see dispatch.go) is a fixed, explicitly
// enumerated allowlist, never a generic "call this internal method by
// name" dispatcher — a compromised cloud backend must never be able to
// construct an arbitrary command (see internal/system.AsteriskRX, whose
// free-form cmd string is exactly what no relayed action may expose
// directly).
