# project are installed, pulls the latest code if there is any, then
# builds natively and redeploys via deploy/install.sh.

# It always builds and deploys, including when the pull found nothing
# new. That matters for a first-time install: the user has just cloned,
# so there is nothing to fetch, and skipping the build in that case
# leaves them with no binary installed at all. Go's build cache makes a
# no-change rebuild cheap, so the cost of always building is small next
# to the cost of silently doing nothing.

# --- Piper (text-to-speech, for the "Create from text" sound generator) ----
#
# Piper's current, actively maintained project (OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl) only
# ships as a pip wheel with no standalone binary, and only for 64-bit ARM
# (aarch64) — no package at all for 32-bit ARM. That's a worse fit here
# than its predecessor project's last release, both because this app's own
# internal/tts package already shells out to a standalone
# "piper --model ... --output_file ..." binary (confirmed against the OLD
# release specifically — the new pip package uses a different, incompatible
# "python3 -m piper -m ... -f ..." invocation) and because HamVoIP
# explicitly supports 32-bit ARM (Pi Zero/1/2) as a first-class target,
# which only the old release covers. That repo is archived (frozen since
# Oct 2025) so it won't see updates, but for an offline-only local tool
# with no network exposure that's an acceptable tradeoff — it's the only
# option that (a) works on 32-bit ARM and (b) matches this app's existing,
# already-tested invocation with no code changes.
